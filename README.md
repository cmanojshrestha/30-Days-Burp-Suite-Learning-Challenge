# About Burp Suite

ðŸ‘‰ Burp or Burp Suite is a graphical tool for testing Web application security. The tool is written in Java and developed by PortSwigger Security.

ðŸ‘‰ The tool has two versions. A free version that can be downloaded free of charge (Free Edition) and a full version that can be purchased after a trial period (Professional Edition). The free version has significantly reduced functionality. It was developed to provide a comprehensive solution for web application security checks. In addition to basic functionality, such as proxy ever, scanner and intruder, the tool also contains more advanced options such as a spider, a repeate, a decoder, a comparer, an extender and a sequencer.

â€¢ HTTP Proxy - It operates as a web proxy server, and sits as a man-in-the-middle between the browser and destination web servers. This allows the interception, inspection and modification of the raw traffic passing in both directions.

â€¢ Scanner - A web application security scanner, used for performing automated vulnerability scans of web applications.

â€¢ Intruder - This tool can perform automated attacks on web applications. The tool offers a configurable algorithm that can generate malicious HTTP requests. The intruder tool can test and detect SQL Injections, Cross Site Scripting, parameter manipulation and vulnerabilities susceptible to brute-force attacks.

â€¢ Spider - A tool for automatically crawling web applications. It can be used in conjunction with manual mapping techniques to speed up the process of mapping an application's content and functionality.

Burp or Burp Suite is a graphical tool for testing Web application
security. The tool is written in Java and developed by PortSwigger
Security.
VThe tool has two versions. A free version that can be downloaded free of
charge (Free Edition) and a full version that can be purchased after a
trial period (Professional Edition). The free version has significantly
reduced functionality. It was developed to provide a comprehensive
solution for web application security checks. In addition to basic
functionality, such as proxy ever, scanner and intruder, the tool also
contains more advanced options such as a spider, a repeate, a decoder,
a comparer, an extender and a sequencer.
